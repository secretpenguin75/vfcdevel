    #        precipitation (Prec) time series
    # Temp : Numeric vector of temperature (Â°C), same length as Date
    # Prec : Numeric vector of precipitation amount (kg.m-2 or mm w.e.), 
    #        same length as Date
    # rho  : Local firn density (kg.m-3), single value
    #
    # This routine use the temperature and precipitation time series to create
    # a virtual ice cores that compiles precipitation intermittency and
    # diffusion. 
    # First, the temperature time serie is converted into an isotopic
    # composition of precipitation using common coefficient (alpha and beta,
    # Stenni et al, 2016). For a specific site where these parameters are
    # available, these can be adjusted. 
    # Then, the intermittent virtual core is computed by adding layers of
    # snow with a width determined by the precipitation amount associated with
    # each events, and an isotopic composition calculated from the temperature
    # time serie. This intermittent virtual core is interpolated onto a regular
    # grid, using a constant step of 1 mm, which can lead to very large
    # variables for important accumulation sites or very long time series. The
    # resolution at which the core is interpolated should remain small compared
    # to the diffusion length (see below). 
    # Then, the isotopic profile is diffused, and the diffused virtual core is
    # generated. Finally, the intermittent (d18O_int) and the diffused 
    # (d18O_diff) virtual core profiles are blocked averaged to a resolution 
    # of 1 cm, a value similar to the thickness of samples from ice core 
    # records.
